Gibson chapter 5 Dynamic Layer
When players start playing a game, it moves from the inscribed layer into the dynamic layer of the Layered Tetrad.  Play, strategy, and meaningful player choices all emerge in this layer.  This chapter explores the dynamic layer, various qualities of emergence, and how designers can anticipate the dynamic play that emerges from their inscribed design decisions.

Gibson Chapter 6 cultural Layer
As the final layer in the Layered Tetrad, the cultural layer is the furthest from the designer’s hand, yet it is still critical to a holistic understanding of game design and the implications of game development.  This chapter explores the cultural layer, where the player and society take control of the game and make it their own.

Gibson Chapter 2 Game Analysis Frameworks
Ludology is the fancy name for the study of games and game design.  Over the past decade, ludologists have proposed various analytical frameworks for games to help them understand and discuss the structure and fundamental elements of games and the impact of games on players and society.  This chapter presents a few of the most commonly used frameworks that should be known as a designer.

Gibson Chapter 3 The Layered Tetrad
This chapter presents the Layered Tetrad, a combination and extension of many of the best aspects of those frameworks.  Each layer of the Layered Trend is further expanded on in the following chapters.  The Layered Tetrad helps you understand and create the various aspects of a game.  It helps you analyze games you love and look at your game holistically, leading to an understanding of not only the game’s mechanics but also their implications in terms of play, socialization, meaning, and culture.
